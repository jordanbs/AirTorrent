# Transcoding
#
# The basic operation of transcoding is pretty simple.  The client
# determines whether it needs a transcode by looking at the metadata
# that came with the songlist (for example, for daap, this is
# daap.songformat).  If it needs a transcode, it requests a m3u8 file
# which contains chunks of mpegts that may be transcoded on the fly.
#
# This scheme does mean that the client cannot receive m3u8 files, but
# I don't think that's important.  If it becomes an issue, I suppose we could
# update the protocol to add a special http query string to indicate a 
# forced transcode.
#
# Future work: maybe hook directly into the ffmpeg libraries, then we
# don't need to parse.

# How does the transcoding pipeline work?
#
# A media object that needs to be transcoded is basically represented
# by a TranscodeObject.  This encapsulates the media file, and the
# actual commands that need to be run to spit out something that's
# playable.
#
# At the moment, the thing that would probably work for everybody is
# H.264 with aac audio (video + audio) or mp3 (audio only) wrapped
# inside a mpegts container.  mpegts is used because it allows for 
# live streaming (and hence, transcoding), without the need for 
# a file container.  Many file containers are actually not suitable
# because they the ability to seek on the output, something you cannot
# readily do over a socket.  The playlist is built manually.
#
# There are basically two components with this: first is the actual
# transcode (currently, via FFmpeg) and segmentation (to split the mpegts
# into mpegts segments) via the segmenter program.  The chunks are labeled
# sequentially and start from 0.  The basic arguments of the segmenter that 
# you'd probably want to play with is the duration.
#
# Now, to the actual pipeline.  When FFmpeg transcodes, output is transmitted
# to the writable end of a pipe.  The readable end is connected to the
# input of the segmenter program.  2 pipes are connected to the main 
# Miro program: the control pipe and the data pipe.  The data pipe handles
# outputting the actual mpegts segments while the control pipe handles
# the signaling.  This mainly allows for two things: (1) to allow the segmenter
# signal when data is ready, and (2) for throttling.  One advantage of this
# scheme is there is no need to deal with temporary files on the filesystem.
# Once a chunk is sent to the client, it is thrown away.
#
# When a client seeks to a position that is not in its current playing chunk
# and does not have the seeked-to chunk in its cache, it may request
# the chunk from the server.  In this case, the current transcode operation
# stops, and a new transcode operation begins at the requested time offset
# calculated based on which chunk was requested.
